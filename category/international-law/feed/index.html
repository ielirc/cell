<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-right has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:21px">
<p class="has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:19px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5"><em>&#8220;A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.&#8221;  </em></p>
<cite><em>Brett Kavanaugh, Associate Justice of Supreme Court of India</em></cite></blockquote>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Every developed legal system possesses a judicial organ which adjudicates the rights and obligations of the citizens of the nation. At earlier stage, the courts were guided by customs and their own sense of justice. With the advent of society, the legislation becomes the main source of law and judges decide cases according to it. Even at this stage, the judges perform some creative functions. The judges to some extent depend on their sense of right and wrong in matters of interpretation or in filling up any lacuna in the law made by the legislation. In simple terms, a judicial precedent is a judgment of a court of law in India which is cited as an authority to decide a similar set of facts and which can be used by the courts as a source for future decision making.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">According to Gray, &#8220;Precedent covers everything said or done, which furnishes a rule for subsequent practice.&#8221; According to Salmond, &#8220;In a loose sense, it includes merely reported case law which may be cited and followed by courts.&#8221; In general judicial sense, it means the guidance or authority of past decisions for future cases. Only such decisions as lay down some new rule or principle are called judicial precedents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Historical aspects of the judicial precedents in India:</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">In the ancient society, there was less disputes and there were very few occasions to go to courts. Local courts like shashan, kula, shreni and puga were existing at that time. They decided the cases falling within their jurisdictions. There was little possibility of development of doctrine of precedent due to lack of adequate sources to keep the record. In the medieval times also there was less scope of precedents. In the absence of a well organized judicial system, no doctrine of precedent developed in India as it developed in England. In the British rule, the present theory of precedent started developing. The Government of India Act, 1935, explicitly mentioned that the decision of Federal Courts and Privy Council will be binding on all the other courts decision in British India. Hence, from 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century till date precedent is a characteristic feature of our legal system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Position under Indian Constitution:</strong></h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Article 141 of the Indian Constitution provides that, &#8220;The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.&#8221; In Article 141 the expression &#8220;all courts&#8221; has been used which creates question that whether Supreme Court comes under the sphere of all courts. That is to say whether Supreme Court is bound by its own decisions or not. The most important instance of the rule that Supreme Court is not bound by its own decisions is furnished by the case of&nbsp;<strong>Kesavananda Bharti Vs State of Kerala</strong>. In a number of other cases Supreme Court has cleared the mind on this point.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Judgments which do not have binding effect under Article 141 of the Indian Constitution:</strong></h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Judgments which include the following are not considered as a precedent:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">The judgment that is not expressed.</li>



<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">The judgment not founded on reasons.</li>



<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">An Obiter Dicta of a case is not binding as it has a persuasive value.</li>



<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Judgments made on Per Incuriam cannot be used as precedent. Literal meaning of per incuriam is resulting from ignorance.</li>



<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Judgments where point of law or particular question of law was not consciously determined are also not binding.</li>



<li style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Court&#8217;s observations on the facts of the case are not binding.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Supreme Court on Judicial Precedents:</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">In&nbsp;<strong>Union of India Vs. Raghubir Singh (AIR 1989 SC 1933)</strong>&nbsp;it has been held that, &#8220;The doctrine of binding precedent has the merit of promoting a certainty and consistency in judicial decisions, and enables an organic development of the law, besides providing assurance to the individual as to the consequence of transactions forming part daily affairs. And, therefore, the need for a clear and consistent enunciation of legal principle in the decisions of a court.&#8221; In the case of&nbsp;<strong>Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. M/s Sun Engineering Works Private Limited (AIR 1993, SC 43)</strong>, the Hon&#8217;ble Apex Court held that, &#8220;While applying the decision to a latter cases, the court must carefully try to ascertain the true principle laid down by the decision of Supreme Court and not to pick out words or sentences from the judgments divorced from the context of question under consideration by the court to support their reasoning.&#8221; Any interim order passed even by Supreme Court is limited to that particular case and should not to be used as precedent for others cases specifically when the Supreme Court itself has earlier authoritatively decided the question which is squarely involved in the latter case. The Hon&#8217;ble Apex Court in&nbsp;<strong>Megh Singh Vs. State of Punjab ( AIR 2003 SC 3184)</strong>&nbsp;has held that, &#8220;Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusion in two cases or between two accused in the same case. Each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between one case and another is not enough because a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect.&#8221; In&nbsp;<strong>Suganthi Suresh Kumar Vs. Jagdeeshan (2002)2 SCC 420</strong>&nbsp;Supreme Court observed that, &#8220;It is impermissible for a High Court to over rule the decision of the Apex Court on the ground that the Supreme Court laid down legal position without considering any other point. High Court cannot question the correctness of the decision of the Supreme Court even though the point sought before the High Court.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Use Google Maps offline so you can still navigate even without a connection</strong></h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">If you&#8217;re driving or walking between places and don&#8217;t have a data connection, use Google Maps&#8217; offline mode. It&#8217;ll still give you directions and useful information like the distance to your destination, what streets to take, and how long it&#8217;ll take to get there.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">You can also download a map of your places of interest ahead of time, and then you get to use it anywhere – even on things like subways!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:400"><strong>Carry a credit card from home country as well as one from destination country</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">If you are traveling to another country, it&#8217;s always a good idea to bring your credit card from your home country with you. You don&#8217;t want to rely on just one or two cards when travelling because that could be risky if one of them gets lost or stolen.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">I always bring my credit card from home, as well as one from the place I&#8217;m going or alternatively an international card such as Revolut. In case anything happens, I always have a way to get money and communicate with people at home.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:0.3px;line-height:1.5">Traveling can be a stressful and terrifying experience, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
